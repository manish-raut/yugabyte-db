## 1. Setting up Kubernetes environment

If you already have a kubernetes cluster you can directly jump to Install Admin Console :-> Kubernetes section.
If you wanted to set up one, for EKS you can refer [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html) and  for GKE [here](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart.)
